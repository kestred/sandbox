========

An open source engine for tabletop playing RPGs for the web.

Argonaut is being developed as a no-download application (no plugins, no exe/jar) to play tabletop Role-Playing Games long-distance without losing out on the funnest parts of the games. Additionally, its intended to facilitate easy math in math or dice heavy tabletop role-playing games.

Initial development will be focused on the core architecture and the PDQ# system.
The core architecture is intended to be Game-System and Setting neutral, and instead be highly extensible to support any specific ruleset and setting.
